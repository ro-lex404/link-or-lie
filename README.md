Website to generate awareness about phishing.
Includes a link checker to check whether a link is an attempt to phish or not, currently using Gemini 2.0 Flash for it.
A simple game where the user has to identify which link is real, which isn't using a spot-the-phish minigame, currently uses hardcoded values and static assets for ease of setup.

FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS
A dedicated model for phishing link detection, for better identification. Possible integration with Gemini to enhance readability.
Using a model to generate real and fake links for spot-the-phish minigame.
Using other frameworks like TailwindCSS, React.js for better cross-device compatibility and for learning purpose.

(EXTRA FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION)
Email attachment to check whether an email address is genuine or not.
